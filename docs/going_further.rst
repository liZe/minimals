Why Minimals
------------

I love games, I love animals, I love small things. And a lot of my friends too! There’s no game about little pocket monsters, so I had to create one!


Why Python?
-----------

Python is a really good language to design a small, OS-agnostic parser. As it is object-oriented, it gives the possibility to follow the specification with high-level classes and a small amount of very simple code.

Speed is not Minimals’ main goal. A game a very complex task, and following :pep:`the Zen of Python <20>` helped a lot to keep my sanity (both in our code and in our heads): code simplicity, maintainability and flexibility are the most important goals for this library, as they give the ability to stay really close to my ideas and to fix bugs easily.


Dive into the Source
--------------------

The code of the library is split into 4 files:

- ``functions.py`` that contains the main functions publicly available,
- ``constants.py`` that contains main constants about animals,
- ``__init__.py`` that imports the functions available at the root level of the library,
- ``__main__.py`` that contains the command-line features.
