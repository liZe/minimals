API Reference
=============

This page is for Minimals |version|. See :ref:`Changelog` for older versions.


API Stability
-------------

Everything described here is considered “public”: this is what you can rely on. We will try to maintain backward-compatibility, and we really often do, but there is no hard promise.

Anything else should not be used outside of Minimals itself. We reserve the right to change it or remove it at any point. Use it at your own risk, or have dependency to a specific Minimals version.

Minimals follows the semver_ (semantic versioning) guidelines.

.. _semver: https://semver.org/
